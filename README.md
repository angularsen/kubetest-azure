# kubetest-azure
Playground for a Kubernetes cluster on Azure

## :warning: I never really got this working
The [official examples from Azure](https://github.com/Azure/phippyandfriends) were crap and non-working.
Besides, I got costs of $200/month on Azure for the absolute minimal Kubernetes setup I could device, so I'm not pursuing this more right now.
